- [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.3) - lots of functions helpers: map, filter, invoke â€” as well as more specialized goodies: function binding, javascript templating, creating quick indexes, deep equality testing, and so on
- [Voca](https://github.com/panzerdp/voca) - ultimate JavaScript library for manipulating strings
- [Postscribe](https://github.com/krux/postscribe) - lets deliver synchronous third-party scripts asynchronously (ads, trackers, etc...)
- [Mobile Detect](http://hgoebl.github.io/mobile-detect.js/) - device detection (phone, tablet, desktop, mobile grade, os, versions, etc...)
- [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) - a bunch of cool, fun, and cross-browser animations. Great for emphasis, home pages, sliders, etc...
