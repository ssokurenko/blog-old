This november I visited [NG-Poland 2016](http://ng-poland.pl/) conference in Warsaw.
The event was really well organized and interesting topics selected. Unfortunately [Todd Motto](https://toddmotto.com/) was not there, but still there were lots of interesting presenters and topics.

Thanks to the organizers team, videos of some presentations already available on Youtube. Hopefully there will be more, especially hilarious and informative presentation by [Shai Reznik](https://www.hirez.io/).

Here I've selected the most interesting ones:
