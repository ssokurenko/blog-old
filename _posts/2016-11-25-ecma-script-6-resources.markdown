ECMAScript 6 (or ES6) is based on JavaScript. Used for client-side web apps and for writing server applications and services using Node.js.
Actually, it's an updated and significantly enhanced version of JavaScript. 

It includes such new features as constants, block-scope functions and variables, default parameter values, arrow functions, classes, modules and many more.

Unfortunately not all web browsers already support ES6, however it shouldn't stop you. You can use [BABEL](https://babeljs.io/) to transform ES6 code to classic JavaScript.

## Getting started with ES6

The best starting point would be reading the [Understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read) book by [Nicholas C. Zakas](https://www.nczonline.net/about/). The book is professionally written and full of clear code examples.

Another great resource is [ECMAScript 6 â€” New Features: Overview & Comparison](http://es6-features.org/#Constants). Well structured code snippets which illustrate the new features of the language, alongside with their anologies written in ECMAScript 5 (old-good JavaScript).
