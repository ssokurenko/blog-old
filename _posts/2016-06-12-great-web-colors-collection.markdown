Sometimes required to pick some random color for a mockup, or even experiment for a design.
I've created a web app with a collection of nice web-friendly colors with easy access to their color codes.
Welcome to see my picks:

[colors.sokurenko.com](http://colors.sokurenko.com/)

Or fork the [repo on Github](https://github.com/ssokurenko/great-web-colors) to keep your collection.

To edit the colors, just update the color codes in [this](https://github.com/ssokurenko/great-web-colors/blob/master/app/colors.json) JSON file.
