[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static web-site generator powered by Ruby.
Eventually you create your content in human friendly formant (YML) and Jekyll generates HTML for the website.
You don't need to use a database, easy to maintain the content and this is extremely secure, since your content is just commited to a git repository (for example [Github](https://github.com/)).

This is solution works well for small and middle-sized websites, especially personal blogs. And using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) you can host such a website for free.

Recently I created two themes for Jekyll, you are welcome to re-use them and/or contribute to the correspondent repositories:

- Jekyll Instagram Portfolio Theme: [Repository](https://github.com/portfolio-central/jekyll-instagram-portfolio-theme), [Demo](https://portfolio-central.github.io/jekyll-instagram-portfolio-theme/)
- Jekyll Smart Material: [Repository](https://github.com/ssokurenko/jekyll-smart-material), [Demo](https://ssokurenko.github.io/jekyll-smart-material/)
